The initial description of the conservation area and the management plan or equivalent instrument specified in points 2 and 3 are verified by an independent third-party certifier at the start of the conservation activity. 4.2. At the end of the duration of the management plan or equivalent instrument and at least every ten years, the achievement of the objectives set at the start of the management plan and the respect of the DNSH criteria are verified. The verification includes an updated detailed description of the ecological conditions of the area as specified in point 2, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the conservation measures, and of the achievement of the conservation objectives, an evaluation of an updated version of the management plan or equivalent instrument, and the recommendations for the next management plan or equivalent instrument. 4.3.

The operator of the area where the conservation activity takes place commits that a new management plan or equivalent instrument in line with the conservation objectives will be produced before the end of the previous plan. 6. Additional minimum requirements 6.1. The offsetting of the impacts of another economic activity is excluded under this activity(10)Biodiversity offsets are measurable conservation outcomes resulting from measures designed to compensate for residual, unavoidable, adverse biodiversity impacts arising from an activity or project after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been taken. The goal of biodiversity offsets is to conserve the same biodiversity values (habitats, species or ecosystems) that are negatively impacted by the activity or project.. Only net biodiversity gains resulting from conservation/restoration can be accounted for as substantial contribution under this activity(11)This can include additional conservation/restoration outcomes beyond offsetting measure.. 6.2.
