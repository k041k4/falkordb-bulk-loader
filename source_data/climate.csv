The restoration plan provides for monitoring which ensures the correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area. 2. Climate benefit analysis 2.1. The activity complies with the following criteria: the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity; the projected long-term average net GHG balance of the activity is lower than the long-term average GHG balance projected for the baseline, referred to in point 2.2, where long term corresponds to 100 years. 2.2. The calculation of climate benefit complies with all of the following criteria: the analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories(71)2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (version of [adoption date]: https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/).. In particular, if the wetland definition used in that analysis differs from the wetland definition used in the national GHG inventory, the analysis includes an identification of the different land categories covered by the involved area. The climate benefit analysis is based on transparent, accurate, consistent, complete and comparable information, covers all carbon pools impacted by the activity, including above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soil, relies on the most conservative assumptions for calculations and includes appropriate considerations about the risks of non-permanence and reversals of carbon sequestration, the risk of saturation and the risk of leakage. For coastal wetlands, climate benefit analysis considers projections of expected relative sea level rise and the potential that the wetlands will migrate; the business-as-usual practices, including harvesting practices, are one of the following: the management practices as documented before the start of the activity, if any; the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity. the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area concerned are used; emissions and removals that occur due to natural disturbances, such as pests and diseases infestations, fires, wind, storm damages, that impact the area and cause underperformance do not result in non-compliance with the criteria of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that the climate benefit analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories regarding emissions and removals due to natural disturbances. 4. Guarantee of permanence 4.1. In accordance with national law, the wetland status of the area in which the activity takes place is guaranteed by one of the following measures: the area is designated to be retained as wetland and may not be converted to other land use; the area is classified as a protected area; the area is the subject of any legal or contractual guarantee ensuring that it will remain a wetland. 4.2. In accordance with the national law, the operator of the activity commits that future updates to the restoration plan, beyond the activity that is financed, will continue to seek the climate benefits as determined in point 2. Besides, the operator of the activity commits to compensate any reduction in the climate benefit determined in point 2 with an equivalent climate benefit resulting from the conduct of an activity that corresponds to one of the environmental protection and restoration activities defined in this Regulation. 5. Audit Within two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and with the DNSH criteria are verified by either of the following: the relevant national competent authorities; an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity. In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit. The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity. 6. Group assessment The compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and with DNSH criteria may be checked at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits.",The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.,The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.,Peat extraction is minimised.,"The use of pesticides is minimised and alternative approaches or techniques, which may include non-chemical alternatives to pesticides are favoured, in accordance with Directive 2009/128/EC, with exception of occasions where the use of pesticides is needed to control outbreaks of pests and diseases.

In accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular Articles 4 and 11 of that Directive, all technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. 2.2. Measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of-the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats. 2.3. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. 3. For construction of new hydropower plants, the activity complies with the following criteria: 3.1. In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to construction, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses in particular the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. 3.2. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the plant is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the plant does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the plant risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the reasons of overriding public interest or the fact that benefits expected from the planned hydropower plant outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the plant cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as refurbishing of existing hydropower plants or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). 3.3. All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. 3.4. The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. 3.5. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not increase the fragmentation of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned hydropower plant may cause.

The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses, in particular, the cumulated impacts of the new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature-based solutions, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment to existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity, including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species; measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. In addition to the mitigation measures, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. That result is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause. Compensation starts prior to the execution of the project.","Operators limit waste generation in processes related to construction and demolition and take into account best available techniques.

In accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular Articles 4 and 11 of that Directive, all technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. 2.2. Measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of-the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats. 2.3. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. 3. For construction of new hydropower plants, the activity complies with the following criteria: 3.1. In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to construction, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses in particular the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. 3.2. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the plant is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the plant does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the plant risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the reasons of overriding public interest or the fact that benefits expected from the planned hydropower plant outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the plant cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as refurbishing of existing hydropower plants or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). 3.3. All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning); measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance habitats. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. 3.4. The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. 3.5. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not increase the fragmentation of water bodies in the same river basin district.

In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to refurbishment/construction, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses, in particular, the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to, where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation/adaptation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature based solution, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment of existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity (including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow); measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species; measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause. Compensation starts prior to the execution of the project.","At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol(604)EU Construction and Demolition Waste Protocol (version of [adoption date]: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/eu-construction-and-demolition-waste-protocol-0_en)..

With the exception of legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums, the insurance activity provides incentives for risk reduction by setting out the (pre)-conditions for the insurance coverage of risk and by acting as a price signal of risk. For the purpose of this point, reduced premiums or deductibles, possibly based on supportive information on existing/possible actions, to policyholders who protect an asset or activity against natural catastrophes damages may be considered an incentive for risk reduction. 1.4. After a climate risk event, the insurer provides information on the conditions under which coverage under the insurance activity could be renewed or maintained and in particular the benefits of building better in that context. 2. Product design: 2.1. Insurance products sold under the insurance activity offer risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by policyholders.

By way of derogation from this point, where legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums prevent the insurance or reinsurance company from providing risk-based rewards, insurance products may instead provide to customers measures in relation to an asset, an activity, or people that prevent or protect against natural catastrophes. Such measures may be provided as information or advice to customers on climate risks and preventive measures that customers could take. 2.2. The distribution strategy for such products covers measures to ensure that policyholders are informed on the relevance of preventive measures that they could take, for the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, including any impact of such measures on the insurance coverage or the premium level. 3.

The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. The assessment considers, in particular, the cumulated impacts of the project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to; where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation/adaptation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society; the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature-based solutions, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment to existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water. Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity, including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow; measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species; measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause. Compensation starts prior to the execution of the project.","Operators limit waste generation in processes related to construction and demolition and take into account best available techniques. At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol(771)EU Construction and Demolition Waste Protocol and Guidelines, Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (europa.eu) https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/content/eu-construction-and-demolition-waste-protocol-0_en.. Operators use selective demolition to enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate reuse and high-quality recycling.","Appropriate measures are implemented to avoid and mitigate harmful stormwater overflows from the combined wastewater collection system, which may include SUDS, separate stormwater collection systems, retention tanks and treatment of the first flush.","The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this Annex. In addition, the following is to be ensured: in the EU, in relation with Natura 2000 sites: the activity does not have significant effects on Natura 2000 sites in view of their conservation objectives on the basis of an appropriate assessment carried out in accordance with Article 6(3) of Council Directive 92/43/EEC; in the EU, in any area: the activity is not detrimental to the recovery or maintenance of the populations of species protected under Directive 92/43/EEC and Directive 2009/147/EC at a favourable conservation status. The activity is also not detrimental to the recovery or maintenance of the habitat types concerned and protected under Directive 92/43/EEC at a favourable conservation status; in the EU, the introduction of invasive alien species is prevented, or their spread is managed in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014; outside of the EU, activities are conducted in accordance with applicable law related to the conservation of habitats, species and the management of invasive alien species."
