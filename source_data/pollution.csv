For all waste treatment processes, the activity complies with the following criteria: 1.1. According to the type of activity, the activity complies with the requirements set out either in the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste treatment(48)Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1147. or the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste incineration(49)Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/2010 of 12 November 2019 establishing the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, under Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, for waste incineration (OJ L 312, 3.12.2019, p. 55).. Facilities that have been granted a derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15(4) of Directive 2010/75/EU are not considered as compliant with the Technical Screening Criteria. 1.2. During the pre-acceptance procedures, at least the following information is gathered: expected date of arrival at the waste treatment plant; contact details of the waste producer, the sector which the waste originates from and the nature of process producing the waste, including the variability of the process; the estimated quantity expected to be delivered to the operator per delivery and per year; description of the waste, including composition, hazardous properties of the waste, waste code and the suitable treatment route. 1.3. During the acceptance procedures, the following elements are in place: a reception facility equipped with a laboratory to analyse samples on site and documented analytical standard operating procedures, with the option to sub-contract analyses to accredited external contract laboratories; documented sampling procedure consistent with relevant standards, such as EN 14899:2005(50)EN 14899:2005 Characterization of waste - Sampling of waste materials - Framework for the preparation and application of a Sampling Plan.; documented analysis of the relevant physico-chemical parameters for the treatment; a dedicated quarantine waste storage area, as well as written procedures to manage non-accepted waste. The personnel dealing with the pre-acceptance and acceptance procedures is able, due to their profession or experience, to deal with all necessary questions relevant for the treatment of the wastes in the waste treatment facility. The procedures are intended to pre-accepting and accepting wastes at the waste treatment plant only if a suitable treatment route is available and the disposal or recovery route for the output of the treatment is determined. For ‘blending or mixing activities’ (as set out in Annex I, section 5.1(c) of Directive 2010/75/EU), the operator is not using dilution to lower the concentration of one or more hazardous substances present in the waste, with the aim for the resulting waste mix to be declassified and become ‘non-hazardous waste’ and thus be subsequently treated in facilities non-dedicated to the treatment of hazardous waste. Dilution is not used as a ‘substitute’ to the adequate treatment of the waste. 2. For the physico-chemical treatment of solid or pasty waste, any treatment for the purpose of treating waste prior to final disposal, such as in hazardous waste landfills, is designed to fullfil the following requirements: limit at 6% the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) maximum concentration in each single input waste to the landfill; limit at 1 000 mg/kg dry matter Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) content of the output waste after a leaching test with L/S = 10 l/kg based on EU Standard EN 12457-2:2002(51)EN 12457-2:2002 Characterisation of waste - Leaching - Compliance test for leaching of granular waste materials and sludges - Part 2: One stage batch test at a liquid to solid ratio of 10 l/kg for materials with particle size below 4 mm (without or with size reduction).. 3. For the physico-chemical treatment of waste with calorific value, measures are taken in order to avoid dilution and dispersion of hazardous substances, and to avoid any high loads released into the air due to inappropriate final treatment of waste with calorific value. Any treatment installation prior to final thermal treatments (incineration or co-incineration) is to be designed with the purpose of limiting the content of hazardous substances (and meet other related criteria) for each single input waste treated at the physico-chemical treatment installation, so that the acceptance levels at the entrance of the final thermal treatment installations are respected. 4. For the treatment of aqueous liquid waste, the biological treatability of the waste water resulting from the treatment of the water-based liquid waste in a biological waste water treatment plant is judged based on the following criterion: Dissolved Organic Carbon DOC elimination of >70% in 7 days (>80% when adapted inoculum is used) in accordance with EN ISO 9888(52)EN ISO 9888:1999 Water quality — Evaluation of ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic compounds in aqueous medium — Static test (Zahn-Wellens method), version of [adoption date] available at: https://www.iso.org/standard/28121.html. (Zahn Wellens), or other commonly accepted, equivalent industry standards and methodologies used to assess bio-elimination and related performances. 5. For the treatment of waste containing Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), all waste containing POP substances listed in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 are controlled and traced as hazardous waste in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2008/98/EC.

Based on this tracking system, the installations treating mercury-containing waste monitor the effective safe fate of mercury and mercury compounds in appropriate final destination. 7. For the (non-combustion) treatment of healthcare waste, the installation implements the best practices set out in the WHO handbook on safe management of wastes from health-care activities(55)WHO, Safe management of wastes from health-care activities, 2nd edition, 2014, version of [adoption date] available at https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/268779/Safe-management-of-wastes-from-health-care-activities-Eng.pdf..
